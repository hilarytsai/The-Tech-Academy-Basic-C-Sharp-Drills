# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Drills
These are my assignments from the C# portion of The Tech Academy's software bootcamp.  These are primarily console apps 
which take user input and perform concatenation or math operations on it.  Some of these will not make a lot of sense outside
of their original context, as the prompts I followed for each of them were just to reinforce what I was learning at the time.
